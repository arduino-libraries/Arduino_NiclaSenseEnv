## üíª Usage

To use this library you can include the umbrella header `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv.h` which includes other header files from the library. Then you need to initialize the device object which gives you access to the different sensor and actuator objects:

```cpp
#include "Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv.h"

void setup(){
    NiclaSenseEnv device;

    if (device.begin()) {
        Serial.println("üîå Device is connected");

        auto indoorAirQualitySensor = device.indoorAirQualitySensor();
        // ...
        auto outdoorAirQualitySensor = device.outdoorAirQualitySensor();
        // ...
        auto temperatureSensor = device.temperatureHumiditySensor();
        // ...
        auto rgbLED = device.rgbLED();
        // ...
        auto orangeLED = device.orangeLED();
        // ...
    }
}
```
Once the desired object is obtained you can call functions on these objects such as `temperatureSensor.temperature()`. A complete list of these functions can be found in the [API documentation](./api.md).
